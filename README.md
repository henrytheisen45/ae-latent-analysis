# AE Latent Analysis

Code for analyzing the structure of autoencoder latent spaces. Specifically,
intrinsic dimension estimates, embeddings, and class overlap analysis.

This repository builds on research advisor's code and is extended
for independent research experiments.

## Overview

This project studies how autoencoders organize high-dimensional image
data in latent space. The goal is to understand:

- Intrinsic dimensionality of learned representations
- Examine neighborhood and class structure
- Stability of embeddings across models and datasets
- Generally test intuitions regarding geometry of AE latent representions

Experiments are primarily conducted on CelebA using models trained on
UWEC HPC systems.
